Blockchain2graph extracts blockchain data (bitcoin) and insert them into a graph database (neo4j).

![Blockchain2graph console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/straumat/blockchain2graph/development/docs/images/b2g-console-screenshot.png)

Here are some use cases : 
* Query blockchain data with the [cypher query language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/).
* Build web sites like [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/).
* Add meta information to addresses and transactions.
* We would love to add your use case here, contacts us !

At [Blockchain Inspector](http://www.blockchaininspector.com/), we are using Artificial Intelligence to fight fraud in the Blockchain and we needed to have a convenient way to access blockchain information. With blockchain2graph, we can analyse blockchain data as transactions between nodes and add meta information on them.

The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/straumat/blockchain2graph/wiki).
